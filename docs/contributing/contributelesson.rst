Contributing a Lesson to Antidote
=================================

The best way to get started building lessons is to get an instance of Antidote
running on your own laptop. Ironing out all of the bugs before you submit a pull
request makes the review process much smoother. For more info, see the
:ref:`local build <buildlocal>` documentation.

You'll also want to get familiar with the :ref:`syringe file <syringefile>` documentation.
