# Antidote

Antidote is a project for making learning automation easier, by providing a fully in-browser learning experience, highly extensible lesson model, all back-ended by real, non simulated endpoints like network devices and servers.

The [Antidote documentation](https://antidoteproject.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) is your one-stop shop for details about Antidote.
