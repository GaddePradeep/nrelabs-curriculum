Introduction
================================

Welcome to Antidote!

Antidote is an open-source project aimed at making automated network operations
more accessible with fast, easy and fun learning. It teaches from-scratch
network automation skills for network reliability engineers (NREs) and other
NetOps pros or amateurs.

In fact, the reference runtime and use case for Antidote is
:ref:`NRE Labs <nrelabs>` and Antidote is the project behind it. NRE Labs is
a free site and training service on the web sponsored by Juniper Networks, but
anyone interested can run their own copy of Antidote by learning about its
:ref:`infrastructure <infrastructure>` and :ref:`operations <operations>`.

Often the first step to learning about network automation is the hardest:
you need to setup complex virtual environments, labs, or worse risk
experimenting in production. NRE Labs was built to teach skills right in your
web browser and let you deal with real tools, code and network devices.

What's more is that often at the outset of the network automation journey,
when one thinks about what to automate, the answer is “the network!” But
specifics about workflows are prerequisite to automating them. That's why the
community here has created lessons and labs with real-life NetOps workflows.
And everything you see and use is applicable and open for you to use back in
your own environments.

:ref:`Contributions <contrib>` are welcome.

*Please note that NRE Labs is currently in limited tech preview.*
