  The journey of technology is long, winding, and full of surprises. When Mark Sollazo, President & CEO and Kirk Hanratty, VP and CTO set our course in 1989, the emerging enterprise network infrastructure market was being driven by the need for PC LAN and WAN connectivity. Throughout the 1990’s our direction turned to routers, ethernet switching, and dial-up remote access What simple concepts today.

  In late 1999, the road to success changed paths again, and at SynerComm we redirected our course to the emerging enterprise network security market that was being driven by adoption of the Internet.
  
  Today, we run along side our customers on the journey towards security, compliance, and infrastructure, serving as an IT Center of Excellence and providing solutions tailored to our client’s unique needs. Our service delivery is robust and accountable, carried out collectively by our two divisions.

  - DeliverIT – Our heritage continues, bringing the best of today’s industry-leading cloud, network, and security infrastructure solutions and services to our enterprise and service provider clients.
