Welcome to NRE Labs! This is a new initiative for making network automation more accessible in a whole new way.

Here, you'll find a collection of courses, lessons, and labs, all aimed at helping you get started with the various subjects within network automation, so you can quickly add skills to your resume, and bring reliability to your infrastructure.

What's more, **it's all in the browser**. No need to download Vagrant, learn Docker, or set up Ansible. Those are all great tools, and you'll undoubtedly want to learn about those as you progress down your automation journey - but if you're just getting started, NRE Labs is perfect, because it has no dependencies. No dependencies on your machine - other than a web browser - and no dependencies on your skill-set.

Even if you're totally coming in cold with respect to automation, then you've come to the right place.

## Instructions

Each lab will come with a lab guide, which you're reading right now. So if you're checking out a new lab, this left side of the screen is where you want to start.

To the left you'll also notice a collection of tabs, each of which represents a resource that this lab will use. It could be a terminal session with a Junos router or switch, or it could be a Jupyter notebook containing a cool automation script, or maybe a regular linux machine for running some interesting tools or applications from. The lab guide will explain not only which resources do what, but also how the whole lab fits together.

We hope you enjoy NRE Labs! Please see Antidote's [contact page](http://antidoteproject.readthedocs.io/en/latest/contributing.html) if you have feedback or questions
