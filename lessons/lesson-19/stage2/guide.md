# Working with Network APIs
## Part 2 - Let's do it in Python!

Hopefully APIs don't seem so scary anymore. However, there's only so much we can get done on the bash shell. It's time to move into the world of Python to up-level our API game.

Python is very interesting for network automation, because it doesn't have the heavy feel of a full-blown programming language, but it's just as powerful. You can get a **lot** of work done in a small Python script you might only take a few minutes to write. Hopefully you'll find this to be true as we go through these examples.

Another benefit of Python is that it's an **interpreted** language, which means we don't have to go through the whole "compiling" process; we can even run one-off commands in the Python interpreter, and not even have to write a script file. For simplicity, we'll be working within the Python interpreter for the remainder of this lesson. Just remember, anything you run in the interpreter can also be moved into a script for you to run later.
