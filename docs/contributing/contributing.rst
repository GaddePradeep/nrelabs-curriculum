In general, there are two area in which to contribute: Antidote infrastructure
and into the curriculum of Lessons. Lessons contributions are expected to be
the most common, and the community is striving to abstract the infrastructure
well enough that no software or platform engineering complexities are
involved in creating lessons.

:ref:`Skip to code contribution <contrib-code>` guidelines, if you're not
contributing to the learning curriculum.

Before setting off contributing, you should have used NRE Labs and have an idea
about the user experience desired if you wish to have your work considered to
be published there. Furthermore, you should read about the
project's curriculum :ref:`taxonomy <nrelabs>`. And in order to test your
contributions before submitting a pull request to the project, it is helpful to
run an instance of Antidote yourself and test your changes. 

This document is meant to convey the spirit of the ideal contribution to Antidote.
Please read on, as it will make the review process much easier. When you're ready
to begin working on a lesson, go on to :ref:`Contributing a Lesson <contriblesson>`
