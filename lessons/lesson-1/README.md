Welcome to NRE Labs! This is a new initiative for making network automation more accessible in a whole new way.

Here, you'll find a collection of courses, lessons, and labs, all aimed at helping you get started with the various subjects within network automation, so you can quickly add skills to your resume, and bring reliability to your infrastructure.

What's more, **it's all in the browser**. No need to download Vagrant, learn Docker, or set up Ansible. Those are all great tools, and you'll undoubtedly want to learn about those as you progress down your automation journey - but if you're just getting started, NRE Labs is perfect, because it has no dependencies. No dependencies on your machine - other than a web browser - and no dependencies on your skill-set.

Even if you're totally coming in cold with respect to automation, then you've come to the right place.
